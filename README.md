##### Governance

A temporary government will be put in place with Gabriel K. as Mayor. Duties will be to manage development of the project, including finalization of the Constitution, as well as arranging temporary solutions for early movers.

### Stage 2 (Master Development Plan)

Once sufficient data and feedback are collected from Stage 1, long term offices are the next logical milestone. These offices should include the incubator, and hacker spaces, as well as ample room for growth. These offices should be built in accordance with a Beta Master Development Plan, leaving room for the other planned facilities, to include:

 + Incubator Area (focus on startup ecosystem w/ 2+ participating incubators)
 + Hackerspace
 + Security Laboratory
 + High-tech, Corporate offices
 + University
 + Co-living, intern, and student housing
 + Administrative Building(s) including Courthouse and Mayor's Office
 + Infrastructure separately metered and administrated

### Stage 3 (Built)

Upon completion of the Master Development Plan milestones, the town can begin operations as a technology testbed. Governments, NGOs and technologists will be able to propose pilots to run on the Beta infrastructure. The results of these pilots will be published and used to inform policy decisions and technology development.
